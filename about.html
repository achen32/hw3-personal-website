      <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a computer science student with a
        passion for music, staying active, and solving puzzles. I've played
        piano for over a decade, and music has always been a creative outlet for
        me. When I'm not coding or playing an instrument, I love to stay
        activeâ€”whether it's on the court or in the studio. I played tennis
        throughout high school and now enjoy playing pickleball and practicing
        hot yoga to stay energized. Beyond movement and music, I  enjoy
         brain teasers and casual reading. I love playing the New York Times games, 
        and I appreciate
        anything that keeps my mind engaged.

      <p>Some books I've been reading recently:</p>

        <li>When Breath Becomes Air by Paul Kalanithi</li>
        <li>The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller</li>
      </ul>
