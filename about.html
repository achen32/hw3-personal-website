      <h2>My Interests and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of academics, I have a passion for music, arts and crafts,
        staying active, and solving puzzles. I've played piano for over a
        decade, and it has always been a creative outlet for me â€” one that
        challenges me while allowing for self-expression. I also enjoy arts and
        crafts as another way to explore creativity. Whether it's painting,
        pottery, or experimenting with DIY projects, I enjoy the process of
        bringing ideas to life through hands-on creation. Engaging in artistic
        activities not only allows me to express myself but also serves as a
        relaxing break from screen time. While I may not be a professional
        artist, I appreciate the learning process and the freedom that comes
        with experimenting and creating just for fun. When I'm not coding or
        working on a creative project, I love to stay active. I played tennis
        throughout high school, and now I enjoy playing pickleball and
        practicing hot yoga to stay energized. Beyond movement and music, I also
        enjoy brain teasers and casual reading. I love playing the daily New York
        Times games, and I appreciate anything that keeps my mind engaged.
