        Hello World! My name is Aretha, and welcome to my small corner of the
        internet. I am a senior at Northeastern University in Boston studying
        computer science with a minor in public health. Originally from the Bay
        Area in California, I've always been surrounded by technology, and I
        became fascinated by how it shapes the world around us. My passion lies
        in software development, and I enjoy building projects that challenge me
        to think critically and creatively. Throughout my time in college, I
        have completed two co-op experiences in full-stack web development,
        gaining hands-on experience with both frontend and backend technologies.
        I have worked with a variety of languages and frameworks, adapting
        quickly to new technologies and development environments. Through these
        experiences, I have strengthened my problem-solving abilities,
        collaborated with cross-functional teams, and gained a deeper
        understanding of software development best practices. This website is a
        place where I share my projects, interests, and experiences. Feel free
        to explore and connect with me!
